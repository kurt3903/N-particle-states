# N-particle-states
Python script that (currently) prints all possible three-particle states, given a system of three particles with four distinct single-particle states.

This script answers the question: Given three particles, and four distinct single-particle states Psi1, Psi2, Psi3, and Psi4 available, write down all possible three-particle states for
(a) Distinguishable particles
(b) Identical bosons
(c) Identical fermions

Eventually I want to generalize this script to print all N-particle states given input of N particles and M single-particle states, possibly expanding to print out eigenfunctions of different Hamiltonians.
